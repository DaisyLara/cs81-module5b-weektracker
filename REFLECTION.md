Were your predictions accurate?
    My predictions were accurate, but my activities were fairly limited for the week so I had a good idea of how boring the results were going to be. If I included a "work" category then the results would have been just as predictable and would have not added value to my personal assessments, so I left it out.
What surprised you about your week?
    Once I saw the total hours I spent doing things outside of work I felt a lot less accomplished than I thought I would. It definitely feels like I should do more running or something on the weekends to add to hoursTotal.
Which higher order function was most useful and why?
    I like the filter function because I was able to stack it with other functions as I needed to. The map() function also seemed very useful in case there are a bunch of irrelevenat properties that I don't need to see.
